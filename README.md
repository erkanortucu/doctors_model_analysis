  In our experiment, we compared the gold standard diagnosis, the doctor's prediction, and the model prediction for a specific case. 
Both the doctor and the model were given the patient's history and asked to provide their disease predictions. The gold standard diagnosis represents
the actual diagnosis of the patient at the end of their diagnostic journey.This experiment aimed to evaluate how well the doctor's prediction and 
the model's prediction aligned with the gold standard diagnosis

 Its purpose is to compare the cancer prediction abilities of experts (doctors) and the model through various statistical tests such as specificity and sensitivity.

-The doctor's prediction (DP1), (DP2), (DP3) compared to gold standard
-The comparision of the model's prediction (MP1), (MP2), (MP3)  compared to gold standard
-If doctor agree with model prediction - MP1 , MP2 , MP3
-If doctor agree with model recommendation-1 , model recommendation-2 , model recommendation-3
